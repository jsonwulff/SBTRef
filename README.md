# SST-2022

Most of this setup was created using [this tutorial](https://www.ludu.co/course/ethereum/truffle).

## Folder & file structure

- `contracts`: Contains the app's Solidity contracts (.sol files).
- `migrations`: The files in this folder will orchestrate the deployment process.
- `test`: Folder for automated tests of contracts (either in Solidity or JavaScript).
- `truffle-config.js`: A configuration file for your project's settings.
